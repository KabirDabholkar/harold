harold
======

This package includes Python3 routines for typical control engineering
tasks. It provides an open-source collection of typical algorithms 
that are often not available for the end user. Instead of a complete
reimplementation of a math paper from scratch or trying to decipher
some FORTRAN code, ``harold`` tries to fill the gap using a
optimized-with-readable-code mindset.
