A systems and controls toolbox for Python3. MIT licensed. See
``LICENSE.md`` file for details.

See the `Wiki pages`_ for a brief introduction.

Useful Links
============

1- There is already an almost-matured control toolbox which is led by
Richard Murray et al. (`click for the Github page`_ ) and it can perform
already most of the essential tasks. Hence, if you want to have
something that resembles the basics of matlab control toolbox give it a
try.

``python-control`` emulates the matlab syntax and usage (for a good
reason considering the matlab users) which is something I really wish to
leave behind completely. Over the years I truly hated that syntax but
that’s just me. Just to name a few, argument hopping thanks to
``nargin,nargout`` stuff, inconsistent (sometimes just stupid) error
handling, weird amalgam of structs and cells usage…

2- By the way, if you are interested in robust control you would
probably appreciate the `Skogestad-Python`_ project.
