======

A systems and controls toolbox for Python3. MIT licensed. See
``LICENSE.md`` file for details.

See the `Wiki pages`_ for a brief introduction or the `Sphinx 
documentation`_. The command reference is located under the 
*Module Index* at the bottom of the page. 

Useful Links
============

1- There is already an almost-matured control toolbox which is led by
Richard Murray et al. (`click for the Github page`_ ) and it can perform
already most of the essential tasks. Hence, if you want to have
something that resembles the basics of matlab control toolbox give it a
try.

2- By the way, if you are interested in robust control you would
probably appreciate the `Skogestad-Python`_ project.
